# Etch-A-Sketch
A project to build an online Etch-a-Sketch program.

This project will require some extensive use of CSS and Javascript starting with building a grid layout as the board.
The idea of 'drawing' on this board will be accomplished as and when the mouse pointer hovers and passes over the grid.
